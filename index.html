        <p2>Korean Dramas tend to focus more on visuals, music and chemistry. KDramas tends
        to be shorter than chinese dramas with episodes mostly range from 16 - 32.
        The cinematology and overall production has a higher quality. Korean dramas are usually 
        1 hour long or sometimes 1 hour and 20 minutes. Korean dramas traditionally follow the 
        live shooting method which means the episodes are still being filmed whilst the drama is on air.
        Korean dramas have a variety of genres from romance, thriller, historical, slice of life, medical, etc.
        The most popular genre of KDrama is romance. Some popular KDramas
        include "Goblin", "Her Private Life", "Weight Lifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo", "Sky Castle",
        "Crash Landing On You", "It is Okay Not to Be Okay", "Moving" and "Vincenzo". 
        My personal favourite Kdramas inlcude "Alchemy of Souls", "While You Were Sleeping", 
        "The Glory", "Doom at Your Service", "Doctor John", "The Legend of the Blue Sea", "True Beauty"
        "Penthouse" and "W: Two Worlds". 
    
        <br><br>
        Chinese Dramas tend to focus more on the story. Mostly longer episodes can range
        up to 60 or more episodes. Many different genres of dramas: modern, historical, etc. 
        The most popular CDrama genre is historical. A lot of dramas are available on Youtube 
        with subtitles. All Chinese dramas are pre produced.This is mostly because China has 
        stricter broadcasting regulations. So the networks want to ensure a drama is appropriate
        before it is released.Some popular CDramas include "The Untamed", "Eternal Love", 
        "Nirvana in Fire" , "The Kings Woman" and "Love and Redemption". My personal favourite CDramas
        include "Fall in Love", "Falling Into Your Smile", "My Lethal Man", "Go Ahead"
        "Love Between Fairy and Devil" and "Back from the Brink".

        A grand prix weekend is 3 days regualr weekends includes 3 practice sessions, qualifying and the race but on 
        sprint weekends it includes 1 practice session, qualifying, sprint shoot-out, sprint and the race. Qualifying 
        and sprint shoot-out includes 3 knockout rounds with the drivers ranked based on their fastest lap around
